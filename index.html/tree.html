<h1>Introduction to Trees</h1>

<p>Trees are tall plants with woody branches that are mature. Trees' primary job is to offer oxygen and food to living beings. Aside from that, they give shelter, furniture, and other necessities for survival. Trees are the most important aspect of the ecology and environment. You may learn more about trees by reading tree poetry for children. Not only will learning these poems for kids help children learn about trees, but it will also help them strengthen their vocabulary and linguistic abilities. Here is some fascinating tree-related poetry.</p>

<p><strong>My Tree:</strong> <h2>Now I will plant this little tree!<br>
    Forever and ever it belongs to me.<br>
    When it’s grown-up I will lift my eyes<br>
    To see my tree against the skies.<br>
    A great, tall, living thing I shall see.<br>
    And how glad I’ll feel that it’s my tree.</h2>
